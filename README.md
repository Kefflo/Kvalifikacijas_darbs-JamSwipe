# What was your motivation? 
My motivation was to create a project that would qualify me for my programming degree. 
I've always had a passion for music and such things, so I thought why not make something that I could use for myself.
# Why did you build this project?
To make it easier for people to listen to music that is on their device locally and help them find music easier to make playlists with.
# What did you learn?
How to handle audio data locally.
# What makes your project stand out? If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a "Features" section and listing them here.
One of my main features for this project would probably be the fact that a new user can select a genre and get a list of songs,
that respond to that genre that was selected.
